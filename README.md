# libsm64 - C# Bindings (WIP)

Bindings for calling [libsm64](https://github.com/libsm64/libsm64) from C#.

This library provides both:
- [libsm64-unity](https://github.com/libsm64/libsm64-unity)'s interop layer for calling libsm64 methods directly.
- A C# object-oriented layer for safely calling the libsm64 methods.

_Note: Currently, only a 32-bit DLL is included with this library._

## Credits

- [libsm64](https://github.com/libsm64/libsm64), the original C library that provides this functionality.
- [libsm64-unity](https://github.com/libsm64/libsm64-unity), which I shamelessly copied the core interop code from.
